gmi.django.profile documentation
================================

gmi.django.profile is a simple Django app that adds profile pages
to registered Django users and publishs them on the frontend.
For now, the profile pages contain an 'about' area, that is
editable using the Markdown markup language, an avatar image
based on gmi.django.avatar and a form to contact a user by mail
based on django-contactform.
